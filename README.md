<h1>Lightbox Gallery</h1>

<p>This shows a display of images (can adjust depending on how many photos are added to the json file) in a photo gallery layout.</p>
<p>When you click on an image, it opens up a larger size of that image in a jquery plugin called <b>lightbox</b> used to cover the background wtih an overlay and allows you to navigate through the available images.</p>
<p>There is also a search bar which allows you to search for images based on their title or caption associated with that image.</p>
